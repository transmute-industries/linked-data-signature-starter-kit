# Linked Data Signature Starter Kit

The purpose of this repo is to provide a starting point for developers wishing to implement JSON-LD Signatures.

I have copied a bunch of stuff from https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-signatures

My goal is to pair these stubs down as far as possible, so that developers can use this repo as a template for creating compatibile signatures.
